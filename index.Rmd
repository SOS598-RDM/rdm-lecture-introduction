We encourage **student participation**. Evidence of being prepared for
discussion in class, including but not limited to having completed reading
assignments prior to class, contributing insightful comments, and a commitment
to class activities will demonstrate levels of preparedness and participation
that enable others to learn from and with you.

**reproducible research** is the ability to recompute data analytic results, given an observed data set and knowledge of the data analysis pipeline.

Replicating studies remains the gold standard for rigorous scientific research, but reproducibility is increasingly viewed as a *minimum standard* that all scientists should strive toward.

**reproducibility for scientific reasons**

* increased trustworthiness
* more rigorous, reliable science
* learning more from one another's work

**reproducibility for personal reasons**

- helps researchers remember how and why they did *x*
- enables researchers to quickly and simply modify figures, tables, etc.
- enables quick reconfiguration of previously conducted research tasks

most basic principle for reproducible research is to **do everything via code**

* downloading data from the web
* converting an Excel file to CSV
* renaming columns or variables
* omitting bad samples or data points

*...do all of these programatically*

Kieran Healy on two revolutions in computing:

"On one side, the mobile, cloud-centered, touch-screen, phone-or-tablet model has brought powerful computing to more people than ever before."

"On the other side, tools for coding, data analysis, and writing are also revolutionary but mostly work by gluing together separate, specialized widgets that do much less to hide the operation system layer, and require knowledge of things like the file system."
