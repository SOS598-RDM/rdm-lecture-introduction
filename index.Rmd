#### SOS 598 Research Data Management

* seminar: SOS 598 (201842), 1 credit-hour

* instructors:
  + Stevan Earl, Data Manager
  + Philip Tarrant, Director GIOS Informatics & Technology


---

#### course overview

* An introduction to tools and techniques that will help you to organize, work with, and publish your research data.

* Hands-on exercises with example data, or your own data if available.

* Grades are based on participation, and completion and quality of assignments.

**student participation:** Evidence of being prepared for discussion in
class, including but not limited to having completed reading assignments
prior to class, contributing insightful comments, and a commitment to
class activities will demonstrate levels of preparedness and
participation that enable others to learn from and with you.

#### office hours

* Monday 3-5, but, really, just about any time by appointment

#### learning outcomes

1.  Understand the benefits of a structured approach to managing the
    data produced by research projects and experiments.
    
2.  Recognize data and metadata quality issues and understand the impact
    on the value of the data.
    
3.  Be able to organize data and prepare metadata to facilitate
    publication of research data.
    
4.  Apply data management principles to prepare a Data Management Plan,
    as required by many funding agencies.
    
5.  Know where to seek new knowledge in this rapidly evolving field -
    unless you are keeping up with it, you are falling behind.

* how do you keep that up-to-date?

--

* what if something changes, what if something needs to be redone - how do you manage that?

--

* why do the results in table 1 not seem to correspond to the results in figure 1?

--

* why were those particular samples omitted?

--

* where did I get these data?

--

* how did I make that figure?

basically, if the thought of redoing your analyses is terrifying üò± then you are doing it wrong (paraphrasing Jenny Bryan)

#### reproducibility

* Replication is the cornerstone of scientific research, with consistent findings from independent investigators the primary means by which scientific evidence accumulates for or against a hypothesis. 

* The **replicability** of a study is related to the chance that an independent experiment targeting the same scientific question will produce a result consistent with the original study. 

* A variation of this concept, referred to as reproducibility, has emerged as a key minimum acceptable standard, especially for heavily computational research. 

* **Reproducibility** is defined as the ability to recompute data analytic results, given an observed data set and knowledge of the data analysis pipeline.

#### reproducibility for scientific reasons

##### given your data, someone else can reproduce your exact results

* increased trustworthiness
* more rigorous, reliable science
* learning more from one another's work

"Science should be 'show me', not 'trust me'; it should be 'help me if you can', not 'catch me if you can'."

*-- Philip B. Stark, <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05256-0" target="_blank">Nature 2018</a>*

#### reproducibility for personal reasons

* Did I mention that subjects with IDs > 100 are actually kangaroos and should be excluded?

* How does that patient have 15 months of treatment when we only followed people for 12 months?

* I won the lottery üëè - now my coworker is taking over

* Journal reviews back after 8 months! Time for revisions!

#### tools we will use during the semester

* Git: distributed version control system

* GitHub: web-based content-hosting platform for collaboration with version control

* Gitkraken: Graphical User Interface for interfacing with Git & GitHub

* R: software environment for statistical computing and graphics

* SQLite: small, fast, self-contained (file-based), high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine

Kieran Healy on two revolutions in computing:

"On one side, the mobile, cloud-centered, touch-screen, phone-or-tablet model has brought powerful computing to more people than ever before."

"On the other side, tools for coding, data analysis, and writing are also revolutionary but mostly work by gluing together separate, specialized widgets that do much less to hide the operation system layer, and require knowledge of things like the file system."
